## General Information
A simulation of a change of an electrical pole, which supposed to be a university project within physics subject. With a help of the simulation you can observe the behaviour of dynamic charges relatively to static charges. After the simulation pipeline end you can easily investigate parameters of every charge in each step of the simulation

## Technologies
- MATLAB(2022)

## Calculations

### Calculation of a field intension



### Calculation of a field potencial

## Setup
- Open the project file with of help of locally installed MATLAB application
- Run 'main.m' function, which will start the simulation pipeline

## Status
This project is stil maintaned
